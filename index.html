    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Final thoughts and takeaways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Class 11 is the most preferred for students to kickstart the prep. One of the reason for this could be that at this class students have finally opted for the desired stream and have a better clarity about their career options</li>
            <li>Local coaching options are most preferred by students as they are much cheaper than big coaching institutes like FIITJEE,ALLEN.</li>
            <li>Dropping out is a big decision and around 75% students decided to opt out. </li>
            <li>The last plot shows that majority students who opted for drop started their preparation from 12th. Starting late compared to their peers can have a negative effect as they would have to complete the vast syllabus in a short time. While there could also be other reasons, example in the case of student who started preparation from 9th opted from drop because of medical reasons.</li>
