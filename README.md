# DAV-Storytelling-JEE

## Project Overview
**DAV-Storytelling-JEE** is a data collection and analysis project conducted as part of the *Data Analytics and Visualization* course. The project aims to analyze trends in JEE preparation among students based on survey data collected via Google Forms. The dataset contains responses from 55 students regarding the class in which they began JEE preparation, the coaching institute they chose, and whether they opted for a drop year.

## Data Collection
The data was gathered through a structured Google Forms survey, which included the following key questions:
- **Class Started Preparation**: When did the student begin preparing for JEE? (Class 9, 10, 11, 12, Drop Year)
- **Coaching Institute**: Did they opt for coaching? If yes, which institute?
- **Drop Year**: Did they take a drop year to prepare for JEE?

## Data Analysis & Visualization
The collected data was processed and analyzed to uncover insights into JEE preparation patterns. The following analyses were performed:
- **Trend Analysis**: Understanding the distribution of students starting JEE preparation at different stages.
- **Coaching Preferences**: Examining the popularity of different coaching institutes.
- **Drop Year Impact**: Analyzing how many students took a drop year and its potential correlation with coaching choices and preparation start time.

## Tools Used
- **Google Forms** (for data collection)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data cleaning and processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis and documentation)

## Results & Findings
1. **Most students start preparation in Class 11**, followed by Class 12 and then earlier classes.
2. **A significant percentage opt for coaching**, with some institutes being more preferred than others.
3. **Drop year trends** indicate that students who started late in Class 12 or without coaching were more likely to take a drop year.
